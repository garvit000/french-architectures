            <h2>Mont-Saint-Michel Abbey</h2>
            <p>Mont-Saint-Michel Abbey is a remarkable medieval structure located on a rocky island in Normandy, France. Originally constructed in the 8th century, it blends Romanesque and Gothic styles. The abbey rises dramatically from the sea, with a series of terraces leading up to a church at its peak. Dedicated to Saint Michael, it was a significant pilgrimage site throughout the Middle Ages. The island is only accessible by land during low tide, which adds to its mystique.
                Today, Mont-Saint-Michel Abbey is a UNESCO World Heritage site, attracting millions of visitors each year. The abbey's architecture includes intricate cloisters, chapels, and defensive walls, providing a glimpse into monastic life. Narrow stone passageways and sweeping views of the bay enhance the experience. The island's medieval streets and buildings are full of character and history. Mont-Saint-Michel remains a stunning example of architectural achievement and spiritual significance.
