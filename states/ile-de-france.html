            <h2>The Eiffel Tower</h2>
            <p>The Eiffel Tower, completed in 1889, is one of the most iconic structures in the world and a symbol of Paris. Designed by engineer Gustave Eiffel for the 1889 Exposition Universelle, it was initially criticized but quickly became a celebrated architectural marvel. Standing at 324 meters, the iron lattice structure was a pioneering feat of engineering, showcasing the potential of iron in large constructions. Today, the Eiffel Tower is a beloved global landmark, offering breathtaking views of Paris from its observation decks and representing the innovative spirit of French architecture</p>
