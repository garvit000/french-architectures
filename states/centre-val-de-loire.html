            <h2>Château de Chambord</h2>
            <p>The Château de Chambord, located in the Loire Valley, is a stunning example of Renaissance architecture. Built in the 16th century under King François I, it combines medieval and Renaissance styles, featuring a symmetrical layout, soaring spires, and a unique double-helix staircase. The château's ornate roof and intricate chimneys make it one of France’s most recognizable castles. Chambord is a symbol of royal power and architectural innovation.

                Today, Chambord is a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of the most popular castles in France. Its vast grounds and forests, once used for royal hunting, are still open to visitors. Inside, the château offers impressive galleries and rooms, along with panoramic views from its rooftop. The Château de Chambord continues to captivate visitors with its grandeur and historical significance.
