        <h1>Grand Est</h1>
            <h2>Place Stanislas</h2>
            <p>Place Stanislas, located in the center of Nancy, France, is a grand 18th-century square designed by architect Emmanuel Héré. It was built in honor of Stanisław Leszczyński, former King of Poland and Duke of Lorraine. Surrounded by neoclassical and Rococo-style buildings, the square exudes elegance and symmetry. Its iconic golden wrought-iron gates and stately façades create a majestic atmosphere. As a UNESCO World Heritage site, it stands as a prime example of European urban design.

                The square is a vibrant hub of activity, often hosting public events and cultural festivals. Its central location in Nancy makes it a gathering place for locals and visitors alike. Notable buildings surrounding the square include the Hôtel de Ville (Town Hall) and the Opéra National de Lorraine. The open, spacious layout enhances the square's grandeur and offers sweeping views of its architectural beauty. Place Stanislas remains a symbol of the city’s rich history and architectural heritage.
