            <h2>Palace of the Popes</h2>
            <p>The Palace of the Popes in Avignon is a vast Gothic complex built in the 14th century to house the popes during the Avignon Papacy. With its imposing walls, towering spires, and fortified design, the palace reflects both religious and political power. Seven popes resided here, and its architecture served to emphasize the church's authority in Europe. The palace includes grand halls, chapels, and defensive structures, blending spiritual and military functions. It stands as one of the most impressive examples of Gothic architecture in France.

                Today, the Palace of the Popes is a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of Avignon’s top attractions. Visitors can explore its lavish interiors, including frescoed rooms, ornate chapels, and vast courtyards. The palace offers panoramic views of Avignon and the Rhône River. It also showcases the history and influence of the Catholic Church during the Middle Ages. The Palace of the Popes remains an iconic symbol of the church’s political power and architectural grandeur.
