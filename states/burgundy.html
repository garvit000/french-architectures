            <h2>Cluny Abbey</h2>
            <p>Cluny Abbey, founded in 910 in Burgundy, was once the largest church in medieval Christendom and a key center of monastic reform. The abbey’s church, with its grand architecture and vast scale, symbolized the power and influence of the Benedictine Order. Cluny played a major role in shaping religious practices across Europe. It stood as a beacon of spiritual and cultural authority during the Middle Ages.

                Today, Cluny Abbey is a historic ruin, much of it destroyed during the French Revolution. Despite the loss, the remaining ruins still suggest the scale and importance of the original structure. The site continues to attract visitors, drawn to its rich history and architectural legacy. Cluny’s influence on European monasticism remains a lasting part of its cultural heritage.
